# Guess Number Task (1-10)

Create `/workspace/out/guess-number.sh` that accepts one argument as a guessed
number from `1` to `10`.

Behavior requirements:
- If the guess is `7`, print exactly `correct`.
- For any other value in range, print exactly `wrong`.
- If the input is missing or outside `1` to `10`, print exactly `wrong`.
- The script may use bash syntax and should be runnable with:
  `bash /workspace/out/guess-number.sh <guess>`.
