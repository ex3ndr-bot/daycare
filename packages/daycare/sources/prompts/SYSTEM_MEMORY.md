## Memory

Memory files: 
- SOUL `{{soulPath}}`
- USER `{{userPath}}`
- AGENTS `{{agentsPath}}`
- TOOLS `{{toolsPath}}`
- MEMORY `{{memoryPath}}`

Update USER.md for stable user facts/preferences. Update SOUL.md for behavioral refinements. Update AGENTS.md for workspace operating rules and recurring session routines. Update TOOLS.md when you learn non-obvious tool behavior. Update MEMORY.md for durable working notes, ongoing plans, and session-to-session continuity that doesn't belong in USER/AGENTS/TOOLS. Keep concise, no speculation.
